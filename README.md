# Infrastructure Failure Simulation for Decision Support

## Overview
This project simulates simplified infrastructure systems to study failure
propagation, reliability, and decision outcomes under uncertainty.

It draws from real-world experience in power and utility systems.

## Problem Context
Infrastructure systems are:
- Interconnected
- Failure-prone
- Sensitive to cascading effects

Understanding these behaviors is essential for robust decision-making and
deployment-aware AI systems.

## Approach
The simulation:
- Models components, load, and failure probabilities
- Introduces random failure events
- Measures system reliability and downtime
- Evaluates simple intervention strategies

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- random
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Systems modeling
- Reasoning under uncertainty
- Simulation-based evaluation
- Decision-support analysis

## Future Extensions
- Policy optimization
- Integration with reinforcement learning
- Scenario-based evaluation
